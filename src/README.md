EngineX - HTTP Server

This project is still a work in progress, and will be a fully multi-threaded (pthreads) and scalable HTTP Server by the time its development is finished.
Currently, serving an index.html file on project's source folder is the only functionality it provides.

(P.S: This source code is an Eclipse project.)
